          <h1>Hi There!</h1>
          <p>I am a <em>Web Project Manager</em> specializing in team management, project execution, and documentation, and have been in the IT industry for 5+ years.</p>
          <p>I believe that a development team's success lies not only on each individual's skills, but also easy access to a <em>single source of truth</em> for organization-specific best practices, standard operating procedures, and a continuously-expanded library of reusable resources.</p>
          <p>Speaking the language of both developers and primary stakeholders, I am an effective liaison between developers and project managers. Translation of stakeholder requirements to developer milestones is second nature to me, as is communicating development roadblocks and other issues back to project managers and clients.</p>
          <p>I'm also quite tech savvy. I find joy in working with Linux web servers to deploy and migrate websites, troubleshooting email issues and improving deliverability, and  building bloat-free websites that load as quickly as possible <i>(this website is only 50kB!)</i> </p>

          <h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
          <p>I see myself as a simple person. I like keeping my hair long <i>(yep, it takes a bit of effort)</i>, playing with my cats, and cruising along the countryside in my motorcycle.</p>
          <p>More often than not, though, I prefer to spend my free time exploring better ways to do things, which in turn also means updating internal documentation for SOPs and best practices. Writing is simply therapeutic to me.</p>
